# Suns Oot Guns Oot App
This is a simple react app that tells the user weather to _get the guns oot_ depending on the temperature at their location.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn to use typescript - This will be the first time I use TypeScript in a React app.
- Practice TDD - Use TDD while developing the app, where possible, using the bundled Jest package.

## App Requirements
- App should tell the user whether to wear a jumper or not based on the temperature
    - If over 15C then no jumper
    - If below 15C then wear a jumper
- App should be a Single Page App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
